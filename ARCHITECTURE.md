# Architecture

## Folder structure

Everything under `app/` follows PSR-4 (`App\`) as usual, but is grouped by what it does, not by
Laravel's default type-first layout:

```
app/
  Domain/<Module>/
    Models/            Eloquent models for this module
    Actions/            One class, one use case (CreateFlightRequest, ConfirmService, ...)
    Policies/            Authorization for this module's models
    DataTransferObjects/ Typed payloads passed between layers (optional, when a plain array leaks detail)

  AI/<Capability>/
    Extractors/          e.g. RequestExtractor — reads an inbound email, returns structured data
    Recommenders/         e.g. SupplierRecommender
    Prompts/               Prompt templates, kept out of the calling code so they're reviewable on their own
    Jobs/                   Queued jobs that call the Claude API and act on the result

  Filament/Resources/<Module>/   Admin UI, grouped to match Domain
  Http/Middleware/                 Cross-cutting request concerns (tenancy, etc.)
  Support/                          Framework-agnostic helpers with no business meaning of their own
```

**Why Actions instead of fat models or fat controllers:** almost every write in this app
(confirm a service, approve a quotation, extract a flight request from an email) is a single named
business operation, not generic CRUD. An Action class (`__invoke()`, one job) is called the same way
from a Filament resource, a queued job, or a test — no logic duplicated across three places.

**Why `app/AI` is separate from `app/Domain`:** AI capabilities have a different failure mode
(a Claude API call can fail, time out, or return something the code has to validate) and a different
review concern (prompts are content, not just code). Isolating them means a change to a prompt can't
accidentally change domain logic, and vice versa.

Filament resources stay thin: they wire fields to a model and call an Action on submit. Business
rules (pricing, risk detection, what "confirmed" requires) live in `Domain`, not in the resource
class, so they're testable without booting a browser.

**One deliberate exception:** `App\Models\User` stays at Laravel's default location instead of
`app/Domain/Tenancy/Models`. Auth, Filament, and most first-party packages assume `App\Models\User`
by convention; fighting that for the sake of a tidier folder isn't worth the friction it creates
everywhere else.

## Multi-tenancy

Single database, every tenant-owned table carries `company_id`. Isolation is enforced in two layers:

1. **`App\Domain\Shared\Concerns\BelongsToCompany`** — a trait applied to every tenant-owned model.
   It registers `CompanyScope` (a global scope that filters every query to the current company) and
   auto-fills `company_id` on create.
2. **`App\Support\Tenancy\CurrentCompany`** — a request-scoped singleton holding "which company is
   this?". Set by `App\Http\Middleware\SetCurrentCompany` from the authenticated user on every web
   and Filament request.

**Queued jobs and console commands don't go through HTTP middleware.** Any job that touches a
tenant-owned model must set `CurrentCompany` explicitly at the top of `handle()`, from the model it
was dispatched for:

```php
app(CurrentCompany::class)->set($flightRequest->company_id);
```

There is deliberately no automatic way around `CompanyScope` — bypassing it means
`Model::withoutGlobalScope(CompanyScope::class)`, which is loud in a diff and should only appear in
genuinely cross-tenant code (a super-admin support tool, a scheduled job that runs per-company in a
loop). If you're writing that, say why in a comment next to the call.

Every module's test suite should include at least one test asserting company A cannot see company
B's records through the resource/API it just built — not just that the scope class exists in
isolation.

## Roles

Six roles, managed via `spatie/laravel-permission`, scoped per company (a user's permissions only
mean something within their own tenant): Admin, Sales, Operations, Procurement, Finance, Management.
Permission definitions live in `database/seeders/RolesAndPermissionsSeeder.php` — that seeder is the
source of truth for what each role can do, not scattered `can()` checks invented ad hoc in resources.

## Documents & communications

Both are polymorphic and cross-cutting — almost every module attaches to them:

- `documents` — polymorphic `documentable`, private storage (signed URLs only, never a public disk).
- `communications` — polymorphic `communicable`, the single timeline (email in/out, notes, call
  summaries, WhatsApp, system events) that both humans and the AI layer read for context.

Inbound email lands via a Postmark inbound-parse webhook (`routes/api.php`), gets matched to a
tenant and a flight, and is written to `communications` before anything else happens to it.

## What NOT to do

- Don't add a model without `BelongsToCompany` unless it's genuinely global (e.g. `Airport`,
  `Country` — shared reference data, not owned by a tenant).
- Don't call the Claude API directly from a Filament resource or an Action outside `app/AI` — route
  it through an `AI/*` class so retries, logging, and failure handling are consistent.
- Don't put validation in the model. Use Form Requests (Filament form validation for panel forms,
  `FormRequest` classes for any plain HTTP endpoints).
